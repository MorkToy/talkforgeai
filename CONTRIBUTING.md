- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable
  snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that
  behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the
  problem.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to TalkforgeAI? You can start by looking through the `beginner` and `help-wanted`
issues:

- **Good first issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `Good first` issues.

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template.
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title.
- Follow the styleguides.
- After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

- Use spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- (TODO) Follow the [coding style guide](link-to-your-style-guide) of the project.

### Documentation Style

- Use Markdown to write documentation.
- When adding new features, include corresponding documentation updates.

## Additional Notes

- If you're unable to complete your work on a pull request, consider marking it as a "Draft" until it's ready for
  review.
